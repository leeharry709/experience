  <h3><p style="font-family: Calibri;">Product Data Engineer II | Expedia Group</p></h3>
  <p style="font-family: Calibri;">Performed ETL on raw data and applied business logic to create production-layer of the People Data Platform. By optimizing queries as well as improving the calculations in our flagship dashboards and products, I improved the performance by over 50%. I also created DAGs to automatically refresh these projects based on requirements. I also pioneered the first automated report built from scratch using Python, utilizing packages like matplotlib and subplots to create striking and impactful visualizations and graphs.
  <br>Skills: SQL, Hive, Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, docx), Tableau</p>

Performed ETL on raw data using SQL and built the People Insights Team's flagship dashboards and PowerPoint slide decks for presenting to leaders of all levels of the business, providing actionable insights to all.

  <h3><p style="font-family: Calibri;">Insights Analyst, People Analytics | Expedia Group</p></h3>
  <p style="font-family: Calibri;">Created the first draft of a workforce planning simulator, allowing the SVP of People Analytics to simulate cost and headcount deltas by adjusting the total number of direct reports each manager has or based on averages by management layer. This simulator would later be used as the framework for a larger initiative led by the chief officers of the business.

  <h3><p style="font-family: Calibri;">Data Analyst | Jackson National Life</p></h3>
  <p style="font-family: Calibri;">Introduced advanced analytics to a growing compensation and HR analytics function. I ran a K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm on tokens parsed from all of our job descriptions to determine the most common and effective skills in our job descriptions based on the role and division provided. This was visualized in word clouds for the Learning Team to build more targeted and effective learning modules for each role.
